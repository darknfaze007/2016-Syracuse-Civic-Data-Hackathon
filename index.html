        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
            We can better understand data that has been recorded by various entities of our local government with data visualization. The result of this is painting a picture of trends and usage of local resources. For local officals this data can be helpful as an
            overview of the past years and as a benchmark for years to come. Make this dashboard publically available and you will create a discussion amongst tax payers on the budget as well as put their minds at ease by showing them how their tax dollars
            are being spent.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
            While data collected on our roadways is publically available on websites such as <a href="http://www.data.gov" target="_blank">www.data.gov</a>, that data can be too abstract to comprehend. The road ratings spread sheet included with this project is 4,867 rows of data
            ranking various elements of that road way on a numbered scale. Even more abstract is the spread sheet of 7,393 GPS coordinates for potholes filled in Syracuse. We cannot see the scope of this data until applying it to a chart or graph. The
            GPS coordinates have no tangible value in our minds until we apply them to a map.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
          Here are a few key strengths of a dashboard site like this:
        </p>
        <ul class="purposeList">


            <li>
                <strong>Accessibility </strong>- This dashboard is accessible to all modern web browsers, the only requirement being an active internet connection to retrieve data, APIs, and frameworks / libraries that are hosted online. This dashboard works on desktop,
                tablet, and mobile in a responsive design. No installing an app or confusing program with pages of documentation to see the data. You just load the webpage. This makes it accessible to all citizens of the area as well as city staff who use this data to work and plan.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sustainability </strong>- The charts can be easily updated within their seperate Javascript files. So when year end comes we can work with the data and update these charts within an hour or two. It could also be linked to exsisting data tables to automatically generate content.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Scalability </strong>- This dashboard is scalable and adding new content is easy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>All API and library elements are open source!</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </main>
